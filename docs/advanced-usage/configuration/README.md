# Configuration

NovaCkeditor comes with a flexible configuration system that allows you to customize its behavior according to your specific needs.&#x20;

To publish the configuration file, you can run the following artisan command:&#x20;

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mostafaznv\NovaCkEditor\FieldServiceProvider"
```

This will publish the configuration file to the `config/nova-ckeditor.php`, and it contains various options that you can adjust to tailor the package to your requirements.&#x20;
